            <div class="container">"Rock, Paper, Scissors" is a hand game common among children. <br> The game is known by different names around the world, including "Paper Scissors Stone" (UK), "Ching Chong Cha" (South Africa), "Janken" (Japan), "Schnick, Schnack, Schnuck" (Germany), and Chin Chan Pu" (Mexico) <br>
                The Rock, Paper, Scissors game is played by tapping a fist on an open palm three times, and then forming one of the mentioned items. <br> A rock is represented by a closed fist, paper is done with an open hand and palm facing down, and scissors are represented by holding the first two fingers straight to form the letter V. Because the game is mostly one of chance, it is often played as a way of making decisions, in a manner much similar to coin flipping.
